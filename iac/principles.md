# Principles & Practices

* Codify everything with explicit coding to configure files in use
* Reduce documentation as it cannot be tested as code
* IaC is the documentation
* Version controlled as the application code
* Can be tested and repeated at multiple stages to ensure quality
* Break the IaC into small modules for greater accountability and re-usability
* Immutable: infrastructure components are required to be replaced for each deployment
