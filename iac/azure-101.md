# Azure 101

* We will leverage Azure to launch VM's using Terraform for the hands-on experience
* Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services developed and operated by Microsoft and its partners
* It used to be about Virtual Networking and Virtual Machines or so-called Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS\)
* Today Azure offers [hundreds](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/) of services from infrastructure to artificial intelligence
* The focus of this chapter is Infrastructure as Code and our exposure to Azure will be limited to IaaS
* Azure IaaS is broken down to regions for proximity, data residency, and resiliency reasons![](/assets/az-regions.jpg)
