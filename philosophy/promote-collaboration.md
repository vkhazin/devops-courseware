* DevOps is all about tightening the relationship between developers, IT operations, and security
* Deeper exposure across all teams to planning, staging environments, testing and systems in production
* Build a deployment pipeline with teams responsible for individual stages
* Checks and balances are implemented by different teams
* Automate approvals from change control boards, security teams, legal/compliance teams, networking teams, and ops teams
* Model the project's value stream from check-in to release
