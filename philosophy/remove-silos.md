# Remove Silos

* DevOps as a set of behaviours and tools that allow a team to function
* Different from the Agile - the ability to move a project along a timeline and accommodating the changes
* DevOps looks beyond development and encompasses all the steps from concept to delivery
* Lack of information sharing prevents development and operations teams from forming trust and mutual respect
* The development team might not report a bug to operations out of fear of finger-pointing
* The first step of DevOps is to get operations and development groups working together to complete the team
* Necessary to obtain a buy-in into a culture of mutual responsibility toward lean manufacturing principles
