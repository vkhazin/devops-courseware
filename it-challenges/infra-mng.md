* "DevOps has emerged as the de facto cure-all for all thatâ€™s wrong with enterprise IT", too optimistic?
* Legacy IT systems still need to run, evolve, and integrate
* Automation of development without automation of infrastructure dependencies? 
* Infrastructure as Code \(IaC\) is a part of DevOps
* [Immutable Infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure) comes with its own promises
* Infrastructure as a Service \(IaaS\) offers agility, velocity, and, maybe, cost savings
