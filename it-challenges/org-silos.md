* Departments are structured to work as separate entities with their own visions, goals and responsibilities
* Development values speed
* Operations values stability
* Testers focus on finding loopholes in the software and ways to break it
* InfoSec's is protecting information from unauthorized access
* As silos solidify, members become more insular and distrustful of other teams/departments/groups
