# Resource Management

* "Let's get a DevOps tool, and life will be so much better!" attitude is a recipe for a failure
* DevOps require individuals with the right skills and a willingness to collaborate
* Forget "I don't know": treat every task as an opportunity to learn
* RTFM: avoid asking peers how something works without reading first
* Search before asking, do not reply-all with: "[What's a GitHub?](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=what%27s+github&pp=1&iie=1)"
* Anything is possible. Never say never. Trust but verify
* Technical debt: whether that debt exists after your time on the project is on you
