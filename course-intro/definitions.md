## What's DevOps

* DevOps is the offspring of agile software development
* A set of practices to automate the processes between software development and IT teams:
  * To build, test, and release software faster and more reliably
  * To increase trust, deliver faster software releases
  * To improve the ability to solve critical issues quickly 
  * To better accommodate unplanned work

## What DevOps is not

* Simply combining Development & Operations teams
* A separate team
* A tool or a framework, e.g. : "_We are DevOps, automatically deploying through Jenkins_"
* A one-size-fits-all strategy, different business drivers and technologies need to be considered
* Is solely automation, it is part of a broader cultural shift and mindset toward staying focused on the big picture
