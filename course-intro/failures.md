# Common Failures

[![](/assets/failure.png)](https://pt.slideshare.net/jsonnevelt/kanban-bootcamp-devopsdays-2014/3)

* Oversimplification: organizations often go on a DevOps Engineer hiring spree to create a new team
* Not using purposeful automation: silos like change management, Dev vs. Ops, or incident management
* Poor test environments: no separate test and production environments that resemble each other
* Rigid architecture: tightly couple software without the flexibility to deploy parts of the system independently
* Incorrect metrics to measure project success: e.g. measuring velocity without quality
